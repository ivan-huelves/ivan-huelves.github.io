In this case it has been developed a basic graphic interface that shows wind speed and direction in a more significant way through variable fonts. Two kind of data recorded by the sensors have been used, **wind direction** and **speed**, applied to a single variable font axis,**slant**.

The purpose is to show how variable fonts can add value to the information representation.
