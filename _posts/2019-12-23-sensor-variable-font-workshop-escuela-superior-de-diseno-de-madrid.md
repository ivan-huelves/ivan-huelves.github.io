In the framework of the subject “Tipografía Experimental” lectured at [Escuela Superior de Diseño de Madrid](https://esdmadrid.es/), I developed with my colleague Lourdes Marco a workshop to introduce to the students the possibilities of building semantic graphic interfaces through variable fonts and data collected by sensors. Moreover, we conducted a validation of the model in order to test its usefulness.

Here are some of the results:

Estela Álvarez Ortiz proposed a mobile graphic interface which makes illegible the text until is unlocked by a fingerprint sensor. In order to put the Sensor Variable Font model into practice, she decided to turn the font 180º creating a font axe called “VLTR” (from the Spanish word voltear).

Celia Fernández González and María González Martínez de Aragón proposed a graphic interface which shows the noise level of a room. The most interesting part of the project is that they put into practice the concept that a font does not have to be composed of alphanumeric characters. So, they designed a glyph with a rectangle shape. On one extreme of the axis is a thin line and at the opposite side is a full rectangle. Depending the noise level registered by the sound sensor the font will grow vertically.
