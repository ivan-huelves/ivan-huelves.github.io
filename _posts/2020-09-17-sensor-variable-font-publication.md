Recently, a chapter on the Sensor Variable Font project was published in the book *Perspectives on Design and Digital Communication: Research, innovations and best practices* published by Springer.

### Abstract
Cities are rapidly developing into so-called Smart Cities, where the Internet of Things (IoT) and the hyper connectivity of citizens are shaping new paradigms of coexistence, so further research is needed on how to improve the user experience through design. One of the revolutions in recent years in the typographic framework are variable fonts, which have the potential of turning typography into something alive that reacts to the environment. In response to this context, we present a model that lays the foundations for improving the process of signification of graphic interfaces through variable fonts, establishing a relationship between typography and the data collected by different sensors, resulting in more satisfactory user experiences. The research is contextualised by a literature review focused on semiotics, graphic design systems, interaction design, graphic and natural interfaces and variable fonts. Then, it describes the elements and the architecture flow of the model and advanced model cases. Finally, the model is evaluated by developing some prototypes. As an outcome of the early approaches to model evaluation, we can confirm that the proposed model has enough level of abstraction and flexibility to be successfully applied to multiple interactive projects in fields such as IoT, games, data visualization, branding or motion graphics.
