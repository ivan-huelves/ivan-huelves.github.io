## The second prototype relates the degree of illumination of a space with the optical perception of typography on screen devices such as electronic books or smartphones.

On the one hand, the elements would be the lighting sensor, with a minimum value of 200 and a maximum value of 1017. It must be taken into account that these values are relative to the light condition of the space so they should only be taken as a reference. It is necessary to calibrate the sensor first. The recorded value is updated every 100 milliseconds. The sensor used is a photo-resistor or LDR (light depending sensor) that calculates the value by opposing more or less resistance to the passage of current according to the lighting conditions. On the other hand the variable typography [Amstelvar Alpha](https://github.com/googlefonts/amstelvar) and the variation axis Optical size, with a minimum value of 10 and a maximum value of 72.

In this case the second step has been to execute the Significant Function on the prototype thanks to the previous reflection. The objective in this case is to improve the perception of the text in a device with screen. Through the variation axis Optical size we can increase the tone of the typography without increasing the width or height it occupies in the compositional space. This is very important because we do not want the text flow to vary in an attempt to improve perception and cause the reader to lose the reference from where he or she was reading. The first significant process would be that of sharpness, as these are subtle changes. And in second place it would be the juxtaposition because we need that the lower the illumination value, the higher the tone of the typography to improve its reading. Finally, the proportionality function has been included as it varies depending on the size of the device’s screen. In some cases the relationship between lighting and tone will be correlative, as in an electronic reader, and in others as in a smaller smartphone screen will be exponential.

Once the significant intention has been established, the Normalizing Function continues, which establishes the relationship between the minimum value of the sensor with the maximum value of the variation axis, and the maximum value of the sensor with the minimum value of the axis.

Finally once the normalized value has been transformed from the process of signification it is decided to apply to all glyphs.
