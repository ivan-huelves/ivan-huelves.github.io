This blog arises from a research framework on the interaction between variable typography and data collected by sensors. As a journal and communication channel, the results obtained will be published here.

Cities evolve rapidly towards the so-called Smart Cities, where the Internet of Things (IoT) and the hyper-connectivity of citizens shape new paradigms of coexistence and interaction. In this context, graphic design will play a crucial role, especially in relation to other disciplines such as data visualization and interaction design. Experiences with interfaces can be much more significant with the use of variable typographies, whose potential lies in turning typography into something alive that adapts to the environment that surrounds it. This research presents a model that lays the groundwork for semantic use of variable typographies in graphical interfaces, establishing a relationship between the typography itself and the data collected by different sensors.
